FABRIC.

What we eat is what we are, but are we what we wear? How we cover (or uncover) our bodies is one but many ways to express individuality. It is a choice we make consciously (or unconsciously) when putting those pieces of fabric together. And choices, do leave their fingerprints on identity, be they diminutive or bold. Clothes and garments are a daily routine that can't be escaped from, and as such I try to make it as a fun and pleasurable part of the day. A good hair day is a great day, but a good \#ootd is a perfect one.

Sometimes, influence comes from really tiny details, but those are details that inspire me to be more conscientious in life, such as using vegetable rubber band to sort as hair band; or, using zip-locks for the accessories. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1604b743-f044-4015-8ca2-5619ac56ff39.jpg)

More often than not, inspiration comes from my profession of clean room ambiences and white laboratory garments. Such inspirations invoke the need for minimal looks, and they feel truly liberating.

Browse the exhibit and take a look into my choices, maybe you'll find yourself somewhere, we could connect through details. After all, 'unique' has no value if it is not appreciated by the eyes of others.
